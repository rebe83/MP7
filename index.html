    </h1>
    Theo is currently a CS undergraduate at UIUC. He graduated from Orion High School in 2017, 
    a class of 86 students. He had no CS experience until coming to college.
    While in high school, he participated in marching band for 4 years,
    often attending honor bands and performing solos. His experiences in high school has led to
    a passion in music. He hopes one day he will be able to play in a band again.
    Career-wise, Theo plans on graduating and then returning to grad school at UIUC to get a 
    PHD in computer science. Then, he would like to use his degree to research human-computer
    interreaction, and find new ways computers can help people, especially those in impoverished
    countries where there is little technological access. He decided to study computer science
    since is apparent that computers have taken over the world, so what better way to help 
    as many people as possible as with computers?
